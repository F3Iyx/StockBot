# StockBot
This Python Bot is supposed to automatically Check and buy products based on links.

Feel free to comment or ask anything you want. I'm pretty new to GitHub and Python and programming as a whole (one year of learning Java in school) and I'm happy about every hint you can give me.
I will also upload my bot on this GitHub-page to make you able to use it (only when I somehow figure out how to do that).
You can also comment what you would like to see featurewise. I'll try to include it in my script.

Quick note:
The bot will be available for Windows as an .exe but you can also use it as a python script on Linux.
You will need the Firefox-Webdriver geckodriver as well as the modules "Pygame" which I use to play sounds and "Selenium" in order to interact with the webdriver.
