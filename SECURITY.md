# Security Policy

## General security information

My program won't harm your pc or any stored data.
When not using the configfile and instructions properly you might buy too many products though.
This should be prevented by the pricecap as well as the itemcap but when you can't trust an algorithm buying stuff with your money you can just use it without signing in at the beginning.
I'm not responsible for anything that happens after you download the package.

## Privacy

The only data getting stored should be the configfile as well as the geckodriver.log.
All of that will remain nice and safe on your pc.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

For reporting problems or security questions please use the issues or discussions tab.
